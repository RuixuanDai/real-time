# Real Time Project

## CSE 530
  - Justin Marshall
  - Jeremy Manin
  - Jonathan Li
  
## Current UI Issues:
  - Need to be able to run node command from cmd line to localhost the app
    - From terminal: node app.js
    - Need to look how to stage app rather then text
  - Once items are running on the node then require.js will be able to be used
  - Require.js allows us to manipulate files with js
  - Set timer on Sign Buttons
